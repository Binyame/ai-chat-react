Since we can't generate PNG files directly, you can:

1. Use the SVG favicon (already works in all modern browsers)
2. Or convert the SVG to PNG using an online tool:
   - Go to: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - Upload public/favicon.svg
   - Download as 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 PNG
   - Save as favicon-32.png, favicon-64.png, favicon-128.png

The SVG favicon I created features:
- Purple gradient chat bubble
- Neural network pattern (representing AI)
- Sparkle effects (AI indicator)
- Professional and unique design
- Fully scalable

Current implementation uses SVG which works perfectly in all modern browsers!
